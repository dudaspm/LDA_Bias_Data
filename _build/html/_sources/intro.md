# Latent Dirichlet Allocation

```{note}
To reviewers - we are utilizing Jupyter Books {cite:p}`executable_books_community_2020` for our development. We did not have any part in the development of Jupyter Books (but we sure do thank them), but our contribution is the content contained in this notebook. 

Also, because of the nature of the resource and making this available as an accessible resource. We were not sure how to completely anonymous the submission. We did try our best to do so.
```

Welcome to our introduction and application of latent dirichlet allocation or LDA. Our hope with this notebook is to discuss LDA in such a way as to make it approachable as a machine learning technique. From "when to use LDA" to "applying LDA to talk about bias," we tried our best to cover the topic in an approachable manner.
